Final project options

Option 1:
Redesign website for my company using a local copy of Magento, without touching anything that is live.

I'm also learning SASS on the side and I think this can be a great opportunity to apply what I've learned in class into practice.


Option 2:
Pizza Maker; make a website with different options/ingredients on the side where you can drag different ingredients on to a empty dough, each time an ingredient is dragged the image changes to show a new pizza with all the ingredients applied. Once pizza is done send the user to a second page whit a message that pizza is done and maybe show an animation of the pizza on an oven.
